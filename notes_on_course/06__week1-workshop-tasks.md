# task 1

basically we're going to be redoing what we did earlier in the week, but with new components.

so we'll make two more stack navigators and add them to our main navigator. in the first task, we set up this architecture
and the empty components.. each component will be based around a <ScrollView>.

# task 2

we're going to build out the contact component here.

We'lll bring in a <Card> and add some <Text>

# task3

and now we make the about component.

pretty breezy!

if there's time at the end let's do a review of redux, which is coming up this week.
